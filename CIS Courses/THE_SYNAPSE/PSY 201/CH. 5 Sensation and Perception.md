## Section 5.1 - Transduction
* **Sensation**:
is the basic experience of stimuli being transmitted to the brain
* **Perception**:
is the conscious experience / organization of such stimuli
---
* **Bottom-up Processing**:
The sensory aspect of stimuli, taste, touch, smell, etc.
* **Top-down processing**:
The knowledge and expectations that come with the stimuli; consciousness
---
* **Transduction**:
The process of translating physical stimuli into neural impulses; or sensory coding. Sensory receptors receive input which is mostly passed to the thalamus. Smell goes to the cortex.

### Primary Sensory Areas in the thalamus
* **Occipital**
	* Vision - Light waves
* **Temporal**
	* Hearing - Sound waves
* **Frontal**
	* Smell - Sensitive ends of olfactory mucous neurons
	* Taste - Cells in taste buds on the tongue
* **Parietal**
	* Touch - Sensitive ends of touch neurons in skin
