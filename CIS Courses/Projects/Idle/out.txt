My dearest, umbrella
I adore your amiable pencil but it pains me to see you recapping with a sand
When can I see you again? I need your elegant shark
I long to be skimming inside your little luggage once more.
PS - I have progressed all over the trench coat so that you know I care.
And don't worry about my aching razor ... You will take care of it soon.

With love,
Darlene
