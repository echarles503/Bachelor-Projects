State of Submission:
-Project is up to spec dtsv[1-2]
dtsv3: 
	Despite the hours put into this project,
	I was unable to properly normalize the timer
	I resorted to using the current time for OneShot
	Repeat has a bunk normalization method to offer a facade of functionality.
 :(
	
-dtsv4 compiles/links with no warnings, no memory leaks 

Notes:
-My compiler was having issues with locating the UOADTs
when the .h files weren't local to my directory.
-I am including them in my submission as a precaution.
