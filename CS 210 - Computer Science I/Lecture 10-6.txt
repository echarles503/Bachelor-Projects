"Days of Coding can save hours of Planning"

USE OFFICE HOURS!!!

---------------------------------------------------

-Focus on functions:

	def et(i,n):
  	  sd = 6500
   	 t =(i-sd-(4150*n))*.2
	return

WHAT DOES THIS CODE DO?
	Generate an estimate for federal income tax based on reported income & number of exemptions.

----------
Every '''docstring''' of every function should include:
-brief description (for each parameter)
-simple examples of use
-calls/called by
-returned value
-side effects(ie. print)
-----------
We finna use the math function this week

-WHY FUNCTIONS?
	-They support abstraction, or reducing complexity by hiding unnecessary detail.
	-Program organization
	-Program readability
	-Code Testing
	-Code Re-use

Recall - defining a function

def twice(x):		#FUNCTION HEADER
	'''		#X IS A PARAMETER
	return value of double-x
	>>>twice(1)
	2
	'''
	result = x*2	#FUNCTION CODE
	print(result)
	return		#RETURN STATEMENT
twice(4)
>>>8

So what happens when you enter this code without calling it?
>>>twice
<function twice at 0x104e7b510>
THE FUNCTION IS DEFINED. IT MUST BE CALLED FOR EFFECTIVE USE.

>>>twice()		>>>twice(3)
??			??
No argument has		#3 is an argument
been supplied		#function executes in order
			#stopts executing at return stmt
			>>>6

Functions breaks sequential order of execution in loops~

---------------
What happens when a function is called??

1) evaluates each argument one at a time, WORKING LEFT TO RIGHT

2) assigns the resulting values to the function parametters

3) creates a space(activation record) on the call stack to keep track of function execution

4) function executes until return statetment

---------------

parameters	 vs 	arguments
-Variable supplied		-Value supplied
when function is DEFINED	  when the function is CALLED

------

def twice(x): ### x is a parameter
'''

'''
return
twice(3) #3 is a value

--------

def twice(x):
   result = x*2
   
   return result

def main():

   bet = 20
   raise_bet = twice(bet) + 10
   print(raise_bet)

   return
---------
Functions ALWAYS return a value
	(sometimes the value is None)
