Initially I ran the program with the settings recursion levels at L1=5, L2=6, L3=7,
which was very quickly refuted by my virtual box. After shifting to L1=1, L2=2, L3=3,
the program was getting about 20 frames/sec for 500 spheres. At the starting frame,
my GPU was rendering 548,192.832 triangles/sec on average. As time passed and the LOD leveled out,
this number became closer to 459,891.376 as the the frame rate while rendering more high detail
geometry.

Running a stress test with 10,000 spheres it appears that there were over 1 million triangles
rendered per second, which doubles the ceiling of the 500 triangles. It's hard to say why the computation
increases alongside the increase in geometry (math issues possibly). Another reason is that the frame rate might
not be an accurate metric, rather moreso an average across multiple seconds.

Shifting the LOD values to L1=2, L2=4, L3=6 and rendering 20 spheres, we see a
respectable 783,393.28 triangles per second. This seems like a slightly more reasonable measure than that
of the 10,000 spheres. It may be due to the reduced triangles, but this felt like a goldilocks combination of settings.
It will just have to be noted that these settings are bottlenecked by the number of triangles on the
virtualbox machine.

An improvement that could be made is only rendering geometry that is in the camera's view fulcrum. It
appears that a large amount of geometry is being rendered but isn't viewable. 






# Triangles per LOD:
L1: 4, L2: 16, L3: 64

Average # spheres rendered at each LOD: (data collected from starting frame, n=500)
L1: 88.8, L2: 249.4, L3: 161.8

(88.8 * 4 + 249.4 * 16 + 161.8 * 64) * 37.29 fps

= 548,192.832 Triangles/sec


Snapshot after level-off:
L1: 5, L2: 190, L3: 305

(5 * 4 + 190 * 16 + 305 * 64) * 20.3672 fps

= 459,891.376

Rendering 10,000 spheres:

L1: 2, L2: 3538, L3: 6460
Frame rate = 2.57181 FPS

(2 * 4 + 3538 * 16 + 6460 * 64) * 2.571

= 1,208,513.976


LOD -> L1=2, L2=4, L3=6:

(0 [spheres] * 4 [triangles] + 7 * 256 + 6 * 4096) * 29.71 [fps]

= 783,393.28
