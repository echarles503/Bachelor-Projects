This is a list of courses and projects that I completed during my tenure at the University of Oregon.

My capstone project for software development can be viewed here:
https://bitbucket.org/cs422-slackers/mctopo/src/master/

This project explores topographical mapping using Minecraft as a medium. 
The program has a full GUI and reads Minecraft save files to generate a top‑down view of the given world‑map.
From this utility, you can interact with the generated map to modify the landscape of the game and save changes to file.
• Applies shading for adjacency and opacity differences, level of detail rendering to optimize loads for large save files, saves session progress
• PyGame and Tkinter python libraries to develop the GUI, Pickle for serialized file output, Anvil for unpacking game data.
